参数含义：
setGradient：
  Set the gradient function (of the loss function of one single data example) to be used for L-BFGS.
  传参： new LogisticGradient(numClasses：Int)
        the number of possible outcomes for k classes classification problem in Multinomial Logistic Regression. 
        By default, it is binary logistic regression so numClasses will be set to 2.

setNumIterations：
  Set the maximal number of iterations for L-BFGS. Default 100.

setRegParam：
  Set the regularization parameter. Default 0.0.

setConvergenceTol：
  Set the convergence tolerance of iterations for L-BFGS. Default 1E-6.
  Smaller value will lead to higher accuracy with the cost of more iterations.
  This value must be nonnegative. Lower convergence values are less tolerant and therefore generally cause more iterations to be run.

setNumCorrections：
  Set the number of corrections used in the LBFGS update. Default 10.
  Values of numCorrections less than 3 are not recommended; large values of numCorrections will result in excessive computing time.
  numCorrections must be positive, and values from 4 to 9 are generally recommended.

setUpdater：
  Set the updater function to actually perform a gradient step in a given direction.
  The updater is responsible to perform the update from the regularization term as well, and therefore determines what kind or regularization is used, if any.
